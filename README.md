# Personal Data Store (PDS) Repository

Welcome to the Personal Data Store (PDS) repository! This repository tracks the evolution of PDS implementations, incorporating various search methods including index-based search, non-index based search, and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for efficient data retrieval.

It also contains a relational database project involving the use of 'JDBC', a database programming interface based on Java, to create a University Management system.

## Overview

The repository contains different versions of PDS, each enhancing data retrieval and management capabilities through innovative search strategies. Below is a brief overview of the main components:

- **Index-Based Search**: Utilizes index structures for rapid access to data elements based on predefined keys or indices.
- **Non-Index Based Search**: Implements search algorithms that do not rely on prebuilt index structures, optimizing search performance through alternative data organization or algorithms.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Implements BST data structures to provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, particularly suited for ordered data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into versions or branches reflecting the evolution of PDS implementations. Each version may contain the following components:

- Version-specific implementations of PDS using index-based search, non-index based search, and/or BSTs.
- Additional utility functions, tests, or examples demonstrating the functionality and performance of each version.
